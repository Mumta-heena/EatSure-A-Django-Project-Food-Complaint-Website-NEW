"I had heard good things about Rose Restaurant so I decided to go ahead and give the restaurant a try. The atmosphere was not what I was expecting. Walking through the front door itfelt as if it was a trying way too hard to be modern rather than Indian. The cashier took our orders and was polite, however, when I asked her to make my food mild she must nothave been listening. The food was brought out after waiting for 15 - 20 minutes and it was so spicy I could barely take the flavor of my paneer masala. Overall I was very disappointed with my experience.",0,heard good things rose restaurant decided go ahead give restaurant try atmosphere expecting walking front door felt trying way hard modern rather indian cashier took orders polite however asked make food mild must listening food brought waiting minutes spicy could barely take flavor paneer masala overall disappointed experience
"I was driving by rose restaurant one day and decided to give it a try during my lunch break. I am not very familiar with Indian food and don't have the option too try it as I was born in Lubbock. However, I am glad that I did because now I know that it is not for me. The  tikka kabobs were way to spicy. I don't know if it were a mistake or all there food is that spicy. The sides of the rice dish they gave me were also burned on the edges making it hard to even want to eat.

"I have been to Gloria Restaurant a couple times but was told to try something else. So I went to Gloria Restaurant to try something new. The servers came to take my order relatively fast and got my food out quickly as well. But the food was decent at best. The bhartiya roti wasn't burnt but was was way to crispy.

"First off, let me say I have never been to the restaurant in person. But from the reviews online I saw that it was not the best dining place. So instead I ordered there food from DoorDash. The food arrived but it did not look as appetizing as it looked on the menu. As I had already ordered the food, I decided to give it a try. However, the curry I had ordered was not as good as I wanted it to be. The spices were too much and the flavor was off.

"Jasmin Restaurant's motto is ""Where Customer is a King"" turned out to not be so accurate. The food from the advertisements of the restaurant were completely different from what we were given. My husband and I decided to visit this restaurant for our Friday night out, but were not impressed with the service at all.

"First time here, and it was a pretty great experience. The guy in the front taking orders was very helpful. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and was very transparent with his answers. We decided to get theTikka Pizza, Southern Curry Chicken Bowl, and the Spicy Chcicken Kabob. We also ended with the Mango Lassi, Gulab Jamun and the Ras Maiai. The Southern Curry Chicken bowl tasted great, but it came out a good 3-5 minutes before anything else so by the time we got the remaining food it was cold. The Tikka Pizza ________. The spicy chicken kabob was good, but I wish it came out warmer and it wasn't very spicy. I enjoyed the salad that came with it and the garlic naan bread was amazing. The dessert were unique. I can't say we were crazy about the Gulab Jamun but I did enjoy the Rad Maiai.The atmosphere was open and inviting, and although not advertised (which isn't a bad thing always) they do have WiFi so as a student you can stop by for a quick lunch and do some studying as well.Overall I was impressed.

"The second location in Lubbock. Rose Restaurant is a fast casual Indian cuisine with self-service similar to the Chipotle concept. In fact, the bowl it uses is very similar to the Chipotle bowl. The dining area is spacious with modern open ceiling. There are two private toilet rooms, one for each gender. The ordering process is simple and straightforward. The menu selection is adequate, not overwhelming and easy to understand. The older lady that stationed at the front counter seems to be of Indian descent so it should hint at authentic Indian cuisine. However, I wasn't impressed with my southern curry entree. It's slightly better than the supermarket frozen microwaveable ethnic meal. The southern curry misses the mark - it lacked flavors and depth. I had more enjoyable and better valued meals at Indian buffets I had visited. An example of Americanized Indian restaurant I like is Tarka Indian Kitchen - it's fast casual dining without skimping in taste. I have known many ethnic restaurants and many more mediocre ones - the latter often have very mediocre chef who wouldn't make it his or her own hometown.",1,second location lubbock rose restaurant fast casual indian cuisine selfservice similar chipotle concept fact bowl uses similar chipotle bowl dining area spacious modern open ceiling two private toilet rooms one gender ordering process simple straightforward menu selection adequate overwhelming easy understand older lady stationed front counter seems indian descent hint authentic indian cuisine however wasnt impressed southern curry entree slightly better supermarket frozen microwaveable ethnic meal southern curry misses mark lacked flavors depth enjoyable better valued meals indian buffets visited example americanized indian restaurant like tarka indian kitchen fast casual dining without skimping taste known many ethnic restaurants many mediocre ones latter often mediocre chef wouldnt make hometown
"I don't hate this place, but there are better Indian food places in town. This is like the Taco Bell of Indian food.

"knew i was in trouble when i walked in the restaurant and there was not the usual aroma of an indian restaurant.This is by far the worst Indian food i have ever had, I am not indian but i have traveled to cities with large Indian populations such as Vancouver BC, LA, and Houston TX. So i have a pretty good idea what the food should taste like. Without sounding downright hateful, this must be what Indian prison food tastes like: it was watery, under seasoned, and made with the cheapest of ingredients. It had no spice which is the hallmark of indian food.and when i asked for chutney to try to spice up the food so it would be somewhat fit to eat, the establishment said: we don't have any but how about a chopped jalapeno pepper?I am sorry but the 4~ 5 star reviews are hoaxes. I will go as far as to say this: this was the worse food i have had to paid for in the last 10 years.",1,knew trouble walked restaurant usual aroma indian restaurantthis far worst indian food ever indian traveled cities large indian populations vancouver bc la houston tx pretty good idea food taste like without sounding downright hateful must indian prison food tastes like watery seasoned made cheapest ingredients spice hallmark indian foodand asked chutney try spice food would somewhat fit eat establishment said dont chopped jalapeno pepper sorry star reviews hoaxes go far say worse food paid last years

When I showed up there was hardly anybody in the restaurant oh, and by the time I left every seat was filled, predominantly with Indian people so you know the food is good and authentic.

"I expected a wait at a new restaurant, but nothing like this. We waited an hour to put our order in. While the line was a moderate size, the wait was due to the fact that they only had one girl working a register. This same girl was also bussing tables and delivering food! The manager and the other girl were standing there seemingly only able to observe. We finally made our way up to the front and the manager asked the girl to have us wait 5 minutes before taking our order. 5 minutes turned to 10 and from what I gathered, they had run out of cooked chicken so they were waiting for more to be done. Ok, fine, but they could have said something instead of leaving us standing there. In the end, the food was not great.

"We love this place! I give it four stars only because it doesn't look super welcoming outside, and it is quite dated and a little dark inside, much as it would be if you were visiting in India, most likely. But if you can get past appearances and our sometimes over-critical American standards, the food is always hot, consistently prepared and really, really delicious. Even when you're the only customer there, and it seems no one else has been there in years, the food is hot and fresh. Then someone else comes in. Then another picks up a take-out order. After awhile you realize they have a dedicated fan base. Dishes are spotless and I've never had a bad experience. Go during buffet hours and you'll leave stuffed. Be sure to visit with the owner, Paul, too. He is a wonderful host - super polite and helpful. Trust me. Give Gloria Restaurant and Paul a chance to make your belly happy.

"This is my favorite restaurant in Lubbock. The food is tasty and filling. At lunch you've got a cheap, all-you-can-eat buffet with a range of different vegetable dishes, meatballs, chicken, tomato soup, and freshly baked naan. At dinner, it's a bit pricier, but the quality of the food is still excellent and you've got a wide range of choices. I especially like the chicken and spinach dish. I love the decor. It's nothing fancy, but it lets you know you're in an Indian restaurant and puts me at ease whenever I go in there. The best feature of this place is the owner/cook/waiter. He provides excellent service, always appearing at your elbow to refill your water and ask if he can get you anything. He is the most polite individual I have ever met.
